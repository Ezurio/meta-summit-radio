We restructuring this repository. Now every release will have it's own branch. 
Not all radios are necessarily supported on each release/branch, even though 
recipes for all radios are present in each one.

lrd-y.0.... branches reserved for the engineering releases, they are generally not
supported and have no expectaion of working properly, unless prior arrangement with
sales has been made, and FAE directed you to use it

lrd-y.x.... branches usually release branch for one or more radios.

Below are the branches to use for the last software release:

60: lrd-11.39.0.x
lwb: lrd-11.39.0.x
45/50 legacy: lrd-11.39.0.x
