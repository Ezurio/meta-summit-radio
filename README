I. Adding the laird-cp layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the laird-cp layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the laird-cp layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the laird-cp layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-laird-cp \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer provides the following modules:
    - Sterling & Summit 60, LWB, LWB5 Wi-Fi driver and firmware
    - Sterling & Summit WPA supplicant
    - Laird NetworkManager

 - To use Wi-Fi driver add "backports-laird" and appropriate firmware recipe
   to your image
   1. Remove cfg80211 and mac80211 from the kernel config
   2. Explicitly add the cfg80211 and mac80211 dependencies to the kernel config

 - To use Laird Network Manager add "laird-networkmanager" recipe to your image

 - Layer provides a set custom images that could be used as example or a base for building ones own

 - To use Laird Connectivity provided supplicant:
    - add the following "<type>-supplicant" recipe to your image
    - add to local.conf or <disto>.conf add the following:
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "<type>-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "<type>-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "<type>-supplicant"
    - Where <type> is 'sterling' for Sterling Supplicant and 'summit' for Summit Supplicant

 - Summit or LWB packages needs to be manually downloaded and placed into
    <yocto top dir>/release folder (if needed)

Additional requirements for Yocto release 'zeus' (3.0) and later:

 - wireless-regdb-static provider must be specified in local.conf or <disto>.conf:
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "<firmware package>"
   The firmware package must be the one added to the image and used for the radio

 - OpenSSL 1.0.x related recipes must be disabled:
   Adding the following text into local.conf or <disto>.conf:
        BBMASK += " \
            meta-laird-cp/recipes-packages/openssl \
            meta-laird-cp/recipes-packages/.*/.*openssl10.* \
        "
