This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4 layer.  This layer should be used
with Yocto versions prior to 3.4 due to an incompatible bitbake
syntax change made in Yocto version 3.4.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/xxxx
  layers: xxxx
  branch: master

I. Adding the meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4 layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-summit-radio layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4 layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-summit-radio/meta-summit-radio-pre-3.4 \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer supports the following modules:
    - Summit 60 series radio drivers and firmware
    - Sona IF573 radio drivers and firmware
    - Sona NX611 radio drivers and firmware
    - Sterling LWB/LWB+/LWB5+ radio drivers and firmware
    - Summit WPA supplicant
    - Summit NetworkManager

Integration notes:

 - To use the Wi-Fi and BT driver add the backports and firmware package corresponding to the
   desired module to your image recipe.

 - Ensure the kernel config does not include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth components that are provided
   in backports as built-in items ('y').  These components may be removed from the kernel
   config or left in as modules ('m').  As of kernel version 5.19, cfg80211 must be included
   in the main kernel config, and must be included as a module ('m').  It cannot be left out
   and cannot be built-in.

   To make these changes perform a kernel menuconfig and/or change the kernel defconfig
   then completely rebuild the kernel:
     bitbake -c clean virtual/kernel
     bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel
       1. Ensure cfg80211, mac80211, bluetooth are not listed as built-in
       2. Ensure cfg80211 is included a module
       3. Explicitly add cfg80211, mac80211, and bluetooth  dependencies (mostly crypto)
          to the kernel config if needed
     bitbake <image name>

 - The Summit supplicant is required for full functionality for all radios
    - add the  "summit-supplicant" package to your image recipe
    - add the following to your local.conf or <distro>.conf:
        PREFERRED_PROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "summit-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant = "summit-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-cli = "summit-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-passphrase = "summit-supplicant"
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wpa-supplicant-lib = "summit-supplicant"

 - Summit Supplicant Libs is required only if CCKM support is needed in the Summit Supplicant

 - Summit Network Manager is an optional component that enhances the functionality of the upstream
   to support features of the Summit supplicant

Additional requirements for Yocto release 'zeus' (3.0) and later:

 - wireless-regdb-static provider must be specified in local.conf or <distro>.conf
   - When using 60 Series firmware packages, the wireless-regdb-static provider must be set
     to the firmware package added to the image and used for the radio:
        PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "<firmware package>"
   - When using IF573/LWB/LWB+/LWB5+ firmware packages, the wireless-regdb-static provider must
     be set to the upstream provider:
		    PREFERRED_RPROVIDER_wireless-regdb-static = "wireless-regdb"

 - This layer provides a set of example image recipes that can be used as references

IF573, LWB, LWB+, LWB5+ driver common issues:
  - The regulatory domain must be specified in the platform based on the destination of the
    target device.  Failure to do this will prevent the Wi-Fi driver from loading.  See the
	  Software Integration Guide for more details.

  - 60 second delay on loading the firmware
    Remove CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK from kernel config,
    to resolve problems with SDMA driver after that one will need to make CONFIG_IMX_SDMA a module

  - STMicro unaligned scatterlist error
    Add  entry to the device tree for brcm driver:
      brcm,sd_sgentry_align = /bits/ 16 <32>;
